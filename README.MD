## FEATURES

She is storing different statistics inside her files, and then you can print them and look at different statistics and histories of you meditations.
- **Distraction-Free:** This app is fully free from any colored buttons and designs, terminal only.
- **Active Development:** This app has a very big change to become into the best terminal-based app. We (developers) will try to add in this app as much useful things and functions in this app to make her very useful for you. Send your ideas to our email!

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

- **Operating System:** Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux. Remember that with some Linux emulators as 'Termux' you can run this app even on your Android phone.
- **Compiler:** Just use 'python main.py' commands, keep it simple.
- **Libraries:** Probably to use this app you have to install some libraries and modules. Use 'pip install' or your OS's package manager to do it.

## TO-DO LIST
- [ ] **Add menu with next functions:** show statistics (will print all statistics from 'sessions.txt' file + print different stats as total time, average time, etc.
- [ ] **ESC key:** I (Vadim Kondratov) can't use 'esc' button on my laptop because this button is broken on him (it's okay for 12 years old laptop which works 8h+ hours every day), and in code instead I setted 'x' as a close application button. Please, instead of 'x' set 'esc' hotkey and send me a photo or video on my email.
- [ ] **Operating in menus:** It will be a good idea to add possibilty to fully operate in this app without need to print a number and then clclick ENTER. So, we have to add possibility to take input from user and use him in our menus (the same as you click 'x' to stop to meditate and close this app.
- [ ] **Share this app:** We have to build a big enough community, which well help us with development and sharing of this app. Maybe then wi will start to share this app in packages as AUR.
- [ ] **Buy a nice keyboard for me:** So, it's more a question for me than for you, but I have to buy a keyboard ahaha. My laptop has maybe 6-7 damaged keys and they cause some problems during development. What do you think about Logitech K120? If I will save enough money from donations, I think that I will buy this model, but what do YOU think about this keyboard? Send me your opinion on vadkonbeats@gmail.com
